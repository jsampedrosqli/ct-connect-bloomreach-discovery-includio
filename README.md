## FAQ

### When will the products get synced on Bloomreach?

- The connector [runs every day at 00:00 UTC](blob/main/connect.yaml#L6), so the products will be synced once per day. If you have just installed the connector, you'll need to wait until the next scheduled job at 00:00 UTC for the products to be synced.

### Where is the mapping for _products_ defined?

- We map the commercetools products data into Bloomreach in `src/services/bloomreach-discovery-catalog-ingestion.ts`.

### Why do we need the `BLOOMREACH_DISCOVERY_CATALOG_LOCALE` env variable?

- By default, commercetools has built-in i18n support. In order to consume the catalog data, we must specify the desired [`LocalizedString`](https://docs.commercetools.com/api/types#localizedstring).

### What is the `COMMERCETOOLS_DEPLOYMENT_KEY` env variable for?

- When deploying a connector you'll be asked to define a "deployment key". This connector also needs the deployment key to be defined as an env variable to work properly.
