# Preview your connector

After creating your ConnectorStaged you can request previewable status. This status will allow you to deploy your ConnectorStaged for testing/preview purposes without requiring certification.

## Request previewable status for ConnectorStaged

Use the Preview Connector update action to request previewable status for your ConnectorStaged.

```bash

--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer {{ access_token }}' \
